codeshape: Generate a PPM image to represent file line lengths.
---------------------------------------------------------------

What
----
codeshape takes as input any file and counts the line length up until
a newline occurs.  The resulting line lengths are used to draw an image
representing the shape of the data.  The output is .PPM which is emitted
to stdout, you'll probably want to redirect that output to a file.
